 In this repo, step by step modelling process of Pima Indians Diabetes Database from www.kaggle.com in order to predict diabetes patient using ML/DL models is described.
 The notebook discusses following steps in detail
 1. Importing Libraries.
 2. Importing Data.
 3. Data Exploration illustrating test of imbalance in data,Correlation in data, exploration by violin plot, swarmplot.
 4. Data Pre-processing & Feature Engineering.
 5. Model Selection illustrating k-fold cross validation and grid search method.
 6. Artificial Neural Network Modeling.
 7. Saving model and prediction using saved model.
 It is found that, SVC algorithm performs better with the an accuracy of 80.05%
